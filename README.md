## MultiAnimators is a plugin for KSP mod development.
### It is a part of the [AT_Utils](https://github.com/allista/AT_Utils) framework.

It provides several animator part modules that, unlike the stock ones, are able to control several animations and, more importantly, all the animations of the same name. The last bit allows the proper use of composit parts that include some animated model several times.

**This is a submodule. Do not checkout outside of AT_Utils or the project wil fail to build**
